Contribution to ECMWF's MOOC on "Machine Learning in Weather &amp; Climate"

This repository includes two Google Colab notebooks for the physics-guided machine learning module:   

1. Physically-constrained post-processing of surface weather   
2. Physically-informed parameterization of subgrid processes for climate modeling
