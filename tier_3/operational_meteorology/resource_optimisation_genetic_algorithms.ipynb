    "# Resource optimisation using genetic algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the use of [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) (GA) to optimise the use of resources. The ECMWF [Autumn 2022 ECMWF newsletter No. 173](https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2022/20502-newsletter-no-173-autumn-2022.pdf) (on page 32) describes how they are used to optimise the placement of virtual machines in a cloud environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is not possible for everyone to play with the example given in the newsletter, this notebook  considers an alternate resource optimisation problem using GA: the [Nurse Scheduling Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_scheduling_problem) (NSP). The NSP consists in organising the working shifts of a team of nurses in a hospital, according to a series of constraints such as _\"nurses must not do three shifts in the same day\"_, _\"nurses must not work a morning shift after a night shift\"_ or _\"these two nurses should not work on the same shift\"_.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms are used to search for optimal solutions by simulating natural selection. The principle is to start with a *population* of possible solutions (*individuals*). Each solution is represented by a vector (*chromosome*) of symbols or numbers (*genes*). The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialisation: a population of several individuals is randomly generated. The more individuals, the more genetic diversity and the more likely that a solution is present in the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fitness Evaluation: in the case of natural selection, the fitest individuals will survive. In this step, we will compute a fitness for each individual in the population, using a fitness function. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selection: In this step, the fitest individuals are identified and selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Crossover: the individuals selected in the previous step will \"mate\", this means that the genes of the fitest individuals used to create new individuals, that will therefore inherit a mix of genes from their parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mutation: because the optimum solution may not be present in the initial population, even by mixing genes, it is necessary to introduce some additional genetic diversity. This is achieved by randomly changing the genes of some individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replacement: in order to keep the size of the population constant, the individuals with the lowest fitness will are replaced with the new offspring created during the crossover step.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Termination: steps 2 to 7 are repeated until the maximum fitness in the population reaches a desired level. In this case, the algorithm stops and return the fitest individal as the best solution to the problem.\n",
