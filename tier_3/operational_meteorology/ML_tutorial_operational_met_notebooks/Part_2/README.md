# Jupyter notebooks associated with the Machine Learning Tutorial for Operational Meteorology (Part II)

In this folder you will find a copy of the notebooks in [WAF_ML_Tutorial_Part2](https://github.com/ai2es/WAF_ML_Tutorial_Part2). These are practical coding notebooks associated with the paper: [A Machine Learning Tutorial for Operational Meteorology. Part II: Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00147).

The only difference between the notebooks here, and those in the [original github](https://github.com/ai2es/WAF_ML_Tutorial_Part2) is that these notebooks have been modified so they can be hosted in partnership with the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) hosted by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Feel free to use these notebooks here, but know they are mostly the same content, just with a bit more notation on who wrote the notebooks and what paper they belong to.

Note there is no Notebook 1 because that notebook is not needed for the google colab env.
