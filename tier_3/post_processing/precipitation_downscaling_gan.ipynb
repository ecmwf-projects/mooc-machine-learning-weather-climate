        "In many applications, we get precipitation fields at lower resolution than we need. For example, climate models usually have resolution in the tens of kilometers. This makes it difficult to study the effects of climatic change on extreme precipitation, which usually happens at shorter length scales. To remedy this, we can use *downscaling*: statistical methods that create higher-resolution fields from low-resolution inputs. These are related to the so-called *super-resolution* methods in image processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generative Adversarial Networks are naturally suited for downscaling because they can learn to create realistic-looking outputs. In this notebook, we'll use TensorFlow/Keras to build a simple conditional GAN for downscaling radar-measured precipitation fields. You can train the GAN yourself, or if you prefer, you can jump straight into generating fields yourself.\n",

        "This notebook is based on the research article [\"Stochastic Super-Resolution for Downscaling Time-Evolving Atmospheric Fields With a Generative Adversarial Network\"](https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2020.3032790), which used a dataset from the MeteoSwiss radar network. To make the dataset a more manageable size and reduce the cost of training, the time dimension used in that paper has been removed, the sample size reduced to 32x32, 64000 training samples have been randomly selected from the dataset."
