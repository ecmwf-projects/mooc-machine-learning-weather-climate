# Jupyter notebooks associated with the Machine Learning Tutorial for Operational Meteorology (Part I)

In this folder you will find a copy of the notebooks in [WAF_ML_Tutorial_Part1](https://github.com/ai2es/WAF_ML_Tutorial_Part1). These are practical coding notebooks associated with the paper: [A Machine Learning Tutorial for Operational Meteorology. Part I: Traditional Machine Learning](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wefo/37/8/WAF-D-22-0070.1.xml).

The only difference between the notebooks here, and those in the [original github](https://github.com/ai2es/WAF_ML_Tutorial_Part1) is that these notebooks have been modified so they can be hosted in partnership with the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) hosted by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Feel free to use these notebooks here, but know they are mostly the same content, just with a bit more notation on who wrote the notebooks and what paper they belong to.

Note there is no Notebook 9 because permutation importance is slow (too slow to run on google colab). If people are interested in the explanations notebook, they can check it out [here](https://github.com/ai2es/WAF_ML_Tutorial_Part1/blob/main/jupyter_notebooks/Notebook09_InterpretationATrainedMLModel.ipynb).
